# AI-Based Alternative Medicine Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered system that recommends **alternative medicines** for a given drug, while also providing information on potential **side effects** and an **image** of the alternative medicine for easy identification. The system leverages **Cosine Similarity** to analyze medicine properties and suggest the most relevant alternatives.

## Features

- **Alternative Medicine Suggestions** – Provides suitable substitutes for a given medicine.
- **Side Effects Information** – Displays the side effects of recommended alternatives.
- **Medicine Identification** – Shows an image of the alternative medicine for easy recognition.
- **Fast & Efficient** – Delivers real-time results using AI-driven recommendations.

## Objectives

- Develop an **AI-based recommendation system** for medicine alternatives.
- Improve **healthcare accessibility** through quick and reliable suggestions.
- Reduce dependency on **manual searches and pharmacists**.

## Methodology

1️⃣ **Data Collection** – Medicine dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. <br />
2️⃣ **Preprocessing** – Cleaning, standardization, and removal of missing values. <br />
3️⃣ **Feature Extraction** – Vectorizing medicine details for similarity comparison. <br />
4️⃣ **Model Selection** – Using **Cosine Similarity** to recommend alternatives. <br />
5️⃣ **Training & Testing** – Evaluating accuracy through sample queries. <br />
6️⃣ **Evaluation** – Optimizing efficiency and correctness of recommendations. <br />

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Algorithm:** Cosine Similarity for text-based medicine matching

## Dataset

The dataset used is **11000 Medicine details dataset**, sourced from Kaggle, containing information such as:

- Medicine name
- Composition
- Uses
- Side effects
- Brand images

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshr2135/AI-Medicine-Recommendation.git
cd AI-Medicine-Recommendation
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open and execute **11000\_Medicine\_details.ipynb**.

## Expected Outcome

- A functional **AI-driven medicine recommendation system**.
- Quick identification of **alternative medicines with side effect warnings**.
- Better **decision-making for patients and healthcare professionals**.
